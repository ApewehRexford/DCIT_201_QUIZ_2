Q1
Write a method called executeGradeReport(double score). This method should not perform any calculations itself. Instead, it must follow these steps:
Call validateScore(score). If it returns false, print "Invalid Score" and stop.
If valid, call calculateLetterGrade(score) and store the result in a variable.
Pass that letter grade into displayPerformanceMessage(char grade) to print the final feedback.
Goal: Show how a high-level method manages lower-level helper methods.

Q2
Create three versions of a method called calculateClassAverage.

Version 1: Takes two double scores as parameters.
Version 2: Takes three double scores.
Version 3: Takes an array of double scores. Each method must return the calculated average as a double.
Goal: Demonstrate how the same method name can handle different amounts of data.
